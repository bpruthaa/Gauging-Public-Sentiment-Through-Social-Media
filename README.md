## Access Twitter Data for Sentiment Analysis (Step-by-Step)

1. Create Developer Account:
   - Visit [https://developer.x.com/en](https://developer.x.com/en) and sign up for free.

2. Create a New App:
   - Click "Create an app" and name your project (e.g., "Sentiment Analysis").
   - Briefly describe its purpose and enter a placeholder website URL (e.g., "http://localhost").
   - Review agreements and click "Create."

3. Get API Credentials:
   - Go to "Keys and Tokens" for your app.
   - Copy `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token`, and `access_token_secret`. Store them securely (we'll use them later).

4. Secure Credentials (Optional but Recommended):
   - Consider using environment variables for maximum security (consult your development environment's documentation for details).

5. Update Your Code:
   - Replace `"..."` in the provided code with your actual API credentials:

   ```python
   consumer_key = "..."  # Replace with your actual value
   consumer_secret = "..."
   access_token = "..."
   access_token_secret = "..."

   # ... rest of your code
   ```

Remember:

- Use Twitter API responsibly and ethically.
- Be mindful of API rate limits (check their documentation).
